# Functional React App Design

[See my presentation](https://slides.com/adamterlson/thinking-functionally-in-react) which includes diagrams for how the codebase is put together.  Pretty diagrams.

## To start:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
